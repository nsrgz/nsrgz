### **Who am I?**
- üéØ I'm an electronic engineer whose goal is to become a **top analog and mixed-signal IC designer**.
- üìù My learning journey is being documented in **my substack newsletter**, so go ahead and check it out, its free! **[Mainly Analog](https://mainlyanalog.substack.com/)**
- üìÄ The AMS IC IPs I'm more focused on are **baseband processing signal** circuits.
- üéì In the long term, I would like to do a **Master's Degree** focused on this area.

### **What's is my experience?**  
I have hands-on experience in standard cell library development using the SKY130 PDK and open-source EDA tools. Strong foundation in microelectronics, circuit simulation, and IC layout, gained through academic research and apprenticeship with the OnChip Research Group. Skilled in Spice-based simulation, Python automation, and using tools like Cadence Virtuoso, Ngspice, and Magic. Passionate about high-speed analog design, collaborative development, and pushing the boundaries of open-source silicon. Eager to contribute to cutting-edge SerDes IP design within a multidisciplinary R&D team.
